# vk-fixer
Simple tool to help gamers and developers with getting rid of bad third-party hooks (implicit layers)
that prevent them from running Vulkan games (or cause annoying validation errors in development).
You can download it from the [releases](https://github.com/knokko/vk-fixer/releases).

## Automatic mode
Use automatic mode to automatically test all implicit layers and check which ones conflict with each other.

## Manual mode
Use manuall mode to manually choose which layers you want to disable. This can be useful for development,
or just whenever automatic mode failed to find any problems.
